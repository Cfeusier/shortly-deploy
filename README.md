# Azure Deploy of Link Shortener App

This is a project I completed during a two-day sprint while studying at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com). This app was built with a pair, using the Node, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Backbone, Bcrypt, Grunt, Bash, Crypto, Mocha, and Chai. The objective of this project was to build and continuously-deloy a secure application. The link-shortening and user-experience was secondary to the devOps aspects of the project.
